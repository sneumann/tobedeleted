* Introduction

This documents describes data import, exploration, preprocessing and analysis of
LCMS experiments with =xcms= version 3. The examples and basic workflow was
adapted from the original /LC/MS Preprocessing and Analysis with xcms/ vignette
from Colin A. Smith.

* Data import

=xcms= supports analysis of LC/MS data from files in (AIA/ANDI) NetCDF, mzML/mzXML
and mzData format. For the actual data import Bioconductor's SRC_R[:exports
both]{Biocpkg("mzR")} is used. For demonstration purpose we will analyze a
subset of the data from \cite{Saghatelian04} in which the metabolic consequences
of knocking out the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) gene in mice was
investigated. The raw data files (in NetCDF format) are provided with the =faahKO=
data package. The data set consists of samples fmor the spinal cords of 6
knock-out and 6 wild-type mice. Each file contains data in centroid mode
acquired in positive ion mode form 200-600 m/z and 2500-4500 seconds.

Below we load all required packages, locate the raw CDF files within the =faahKO=
package and build a /phenodata/ data frame describing the experiment.

#+NAME: load-libs-pheno
#+BEGIN_SRC R :results silent
  library(xcms)
  library(MSnbase)
  library(faahKO)

  ## Get the full path to the CDF files
  cdfs <- dir(system.file("cdf", package = "faahKO"), full.names = TRUE,
              recursive = TRUE)
  ## Create a phenodata data.frame
  pd <- data.frame(sample_name = sub(basename(cdfs), pattern = ".CDF",
                                     replacement = "", fixed = TRUE),
                   sample_group = c(rep("KO", 6), rep("WT", 6)),
                   stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
#+END_SRC

Subsequently we load the raw data as an =OnDiskMSnExp= object using the
=readMSData= method from the =MSnbase= package. While the =MSnbase= package was
originally developed for proteomics data processing, many of its functionality,
including raw data import and data representation, can be shared and reused in
metabolomics data analysis.

#+NAME: load-with-msnbase
#+BEGIN_SRC R :results silent

#+END_SRC

The =OnDiskMSnExp= object contains general information about the number of
spectra, retention times, the measured total ion current etc, but does not
contain the full raw data (i.e. the m/z and intensity values from each measured
spectrum). Its memory footprint is thus rather small making it an ideal object
to represent large metabolomics experiments while still allowing to perform
simple quality controls, data inspection and exploration as well as data
sub-setting operations. The m/z and intensity values are imported on the fly
when needed hence the location of the raw data files should not be changed after
initial data import.
